       Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency created in 2008 by an unknown entity using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates on a peer-to-peer network, allowing users to send and receive payments without the need for intermediaries like banks. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security. Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, which makes it scarce and often referred to as "digital gold." While it is highly volatile, Bitcoin has become a widely used asset for investment, remittances, and digital payments across the globe.
